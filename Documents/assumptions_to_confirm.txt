Assumptions To Confirm:

The calendar event of type assignment is more important than others when deciding their priorities, from which the auto-allocating algorihtm works. (Confirmed)
Self assigned priorities take precedence over deadlines. (Confirmed)

Do we need to limit the amount of time spent on studying every day? In other words, balance between work and study?

Do we need the user to input sleep data?


Confirmed Assumptions:
Assignment does not matter, sort all dynamic events according to the deadline. The eariler the deadline, the higher the priority.
Do not implement self-assigned priority, use deadline as priority.

When dynamic events are full, prompt user, there is no time.
